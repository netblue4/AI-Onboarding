These details collectively demonstrate that the AI system’s behavior, purpose, and mitigations are fully defined before deployment, aligning system design with organizational, ethical, and regulatory obligations. The “Risk” node in each RAG component addresses this requirement by documenting the security and integrity requirements of individual modules. It defines specific threats (for example, malicious data ingestion or data poisoning), the associated controls, control objectives, and audit evidence, all structured to promote traceability from risk identification through control design. These elements collectively satisfy the documentation requirement for non-functional aspects such as integrity and confidentiality. Complementing the security and risk documentation, the functional requirements are captured through the structured webform aligned with ISO 42001 A.9.4 on intended use. This JSON schema defines how functional details are gathered and documented, ensuring that each AI system’s intended behavior and operational scope are transparent and justified. It includes fields such as the AI System ID, Name, Business Purpose, Intended Use, and Augmented Tasks, along with selectable benefit outcomes (for example, faster service or increased efficiency). By pairing the A.9.4 functional specification webform with each component’s “Risk” node, the AI onboarding documentation holistically fulfills A.6.2.2 by ensuring that every RAG-based component has a documented purpose, defined operational boundary, articulated risks, and mapped controls. This creates a single, integrated framework for demonstrating how AI system design aligns with organizational objectives and responsible use obligations throughout the lifecycle."

The step also ensures that prerequisite verification is performed so that all technical, security, ethical, and performance benchmarks are met via rigorous pre-deployment testing and validation. Secure packaging controls are enforced to guarantee the integrity of each deployable artifact, requiring container images to be sourced only from trusted registries, scanned for vulnerabilities, and hardened before deployment, as documented with evidence such as configuration files, automated pruning job logs, and access control settings.
