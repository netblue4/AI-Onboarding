The “Risk” node in each RAG component addresses this requirement by documenting the security and integrity requirements of individual modules. It defines specific threats (for example, malicious data ingestion or data poisoning), the associated controls, control objectives, and audit evidence, all structured to promote traceability from risk identification through control design. These elements collectively satisfy the documentation requirement for non-functional aspects such as integrity and confidentiality. Complementing the security and risk documentation, the functional requirements are captured through the structured webform aligned with ISO 42001 A.9.4 on intended use. This JSON schema defines how functional details are gathered and documented, ensuring that each AI system’s intended behavior and operational scope are transparent and justified. It includes fields such as the AI System ID, Name, Business Purpose, Intended Use, and Augmented Tasks, along with selectable benefit outcomes (for example, faster service or increased efficiency). By pairing the A.9.4 functional specification webform with each component’s “Risk” node, the AI onboarding documentation holistically fulfills A.6.2.2 by ensuring that every RAG-based component has a documented purpose, defined operational boundary, articulated risks, and mapped controls.

Step: (A.6.2.5) AI Lifecycle Phase requirements - Deployment addresses these requirements by orchestrating a secure and compliant AI system deployment through several key mechanisms: it requires the documentation of a comprehensive deployment plan that defines the rollout strategy, resource allocation, technical steps, and rollback procedures, providing clear evidence of a controlled deployment process. The step also ensures that prerequisite verification is performed so that all technical, security, ethical, and performance benchmarks are met via rigorous pre-deployment testing and validation. Secure packaging controls are enforced to guarantee the integrity of each deployable artifact, requiring container images to be sourced only from trusted registries, scanned for vulnerabilities, and hardened before deployment, as documented with evidence such as configuration files, automated pruning job logs, and access control settings.

Together the procedure steps addresses the requirements by providing a structured framework that documents our entire data management strategy (A.7.2). The four detailed test plans—'Performance & Load Test Plan', 'Fairness and Bias', 'Transparency and Explainability' and 'Data quality requirements'—explicitly define the criteria and methods for data preparation (A.7.6) and set clear, measurable requirements for data quality, including accuracy, completeness, and fairness (A.7.4). The 'Fairness and Bias' plan also addresses data acquisition and selection (A.7.3) by requiring an analysis of the dataset's representativeness against real-world populations. Furthermore, the 'Data quality requirements' plan establishes a concrete process for recording and verifying the data's origin and history through specific provenance criteria (DATA-SEN-05) and associated test steps (BBT-EXT-PRO-01, BBT-EXT-PRO-02), fulfilling the data provenance mandate (A.7.5). The detailed PlanSteps within each section serve as the documented implementation and verification procedure, ensuring these defined requirements are consistently met."

The process begins with the (A.9.3) AI system's Objectives for Responsible Use step, where we formally document the high-level rules by defining permitted use categories, prohibited uses, and authorized users. These rules are then translated into a concrete technical process within the RAG Orchestrator component, which documents the specific controls—like the prompt classification module and prohibited terms monitoring—that build the enforcement of these objectives directly into the system's architecture. Finally, the process is verified through the (A.9.4) - Purpose Limitation and Prompt Category Enforcement Test Plan in the (A.6.2.4) AI Systems verifications step, which documents the exact testing procedures to ensure these technical controls are implemented correctly and are effective. Together, these three steps form a complete, auditable process for defining, technically enforcing, and validating the responsible use of the AI system."
